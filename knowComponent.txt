📁 Root Level

These files are for configuration and dependencies.

.next/

Auto-generated by Next.js when app runs.
Contains compiled code, caches, chunks. Don’t modify.

node_modules/

All installed libraries from package.json.

public/

Static files (images, icons, logos, videos).
Accessible through URL like /logo.png.

package.json / package-lock.json

Your project metadata and dependencies.

next.config.ts

Custom Next.js config (redirects, images, headers, experimental features).

tsconfig.json

TypeScript configuration.

postcss.config.mjs

PostCSS setup used by Tailwind.

eslint.config.mjs

ESLint rules for code quality.

README.md

Your project documentation.

📁 src/ — Main Application Code

Everything related to the app lives inside this folder.
You keep it clean and modular — good architecture.

📁 src/app/ — App Router (Pages, Routing, Layouts)

This is where your pages live.

Examples:

/app/page.tsx → Home page

/app/dashboard/page.tsx → /dashboard

/app/api/... → API routes

This is Next.js 13+ App Router, the modern structure.

📁 src/component/ — Reusable UI Components

Everything reusable like:

Buttons

Cards

Navigation

Footer

Inputs

Modals

These are presentation-only (no heavy logic).

📁 src/context/ — React Context Providers (Global State)

Used for global state management such as:

Authentication (user logged in or not)

Theme

Cart (if e-commerce)

Notifications

Example: authcontext.tsx

📁 src/hooks/ — Custom Hooks (Reusable Logic)

Custom React hooks such as:

useAuth()

useFetch()

useStorage()

useDebounce()

useUser()

These contain logic you want to reuse across components.

📁 src/middleware/ — Route / API Middlewares

Example: authmiddleware.ts

Used for:

Protecting pages

Checking login state before rendering

Redirecting unauthorized users

Adding headers

This connects with Next.js middleware system.

📁 src/services/ — API Call Functions (Frontend -> Backend)

This is your business logic layer.

Examples:

auth.service.ts → login, signup

user.service.ts → get user data

scrap.service.ts → create scrap listing

upload.service.ts → handle uploads

Why good?

Keeps components clean

Maintains separation of concerns

📁 src/types/ — TypeScript Interfaces & Types

Examples:

User

ResponseTypes

ScrapItem

ApiError

This improves TypeScript safety and auto-completion.

📁 src/utils/ — Utility Helper Functions

Examples:

Convert objects to FormData

Format dates

Validate input

Parse tokens

formdata.ts you already have.

These are pure functions reused everywhere.

🎯 Final Thoughts

Your folder structure is excellent — clean, scalable, professional.

This is exactly the kind of architecture used in:

Production Next.js apps

SaaS dashboards

Admin panels

Marketplace apps (like your scrap-selling app)
